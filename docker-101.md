### Talking points:
- Container vs VM
    - image vs vhd
    - Colonel Kernel
- Windows Containers and that other flavor....
- What's needed?
- Where do I register?


### It's all about the bass, er, CLI
- pull
- images
- run
- ps
- inspect
- logs
- exec
- stop
- rm
- rmi
- build

### Now I know everything, almost...
- volumes
- network

- So, what's best??
